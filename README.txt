To run this program, you will need to generate API keys from OpenAI, Browserless, and Serper. These keys will be used to authenticate your program and allow it to access the respective services.

Follow these steps to create your API keys and set up your environment:

Create API keys:

OpenAI: Visit the OpenAI API webpage and follow the instructions to create an API key.
Browserless: Navigate to the Browserless API section and create an API key following the provided instructions.
Serper: Visit the Serper API page and generate an API key as per the guidelines.
Create a .env file: Once you have created your API keys, you need to store them in a .env file. This is a hidden file that stores environment variables, which are typically configuration values. You can create this file in the root directory of your project.

Set up your environment variables: In your .env file, assign your API keys to the appropriate variable names. Each variable should be on its own line, in the format VARIABLE_NAME="Your API Key". Here's what it should look like:

OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
BROWSERLESS_API_KEY="your_browserless_api_key"
SERP_API_KEY="your_serper_api_key"

Replace "your_openai_api_key", "your_browserless_api_key", and "your_serper_api_key" with the respective keys you generated earlier. Make sure to keep the quotation marks to ensure the keys are treated as strings.

That's it! With these steps, your program should be able to use the keys to authenticate with the respective services.

Note: Ensure that your .env file is listed in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to your git repository. This helps to keep your keys secure.
